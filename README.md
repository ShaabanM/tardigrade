# TARDIGRADE

This repo will be the central hub for the TARDIGRADE project.

## Testing software

The software here will build on the existing repot SMRT, a Python-based software package intended to monitor computer system performance during radiation testing. The original repo can be found here: https://github.com/nasa/System_Monitor_for_Radiation_Testing
