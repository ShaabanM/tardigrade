# SMRT Notes

## Installing SMRT

- Begin by going to the setup dir and runing the install tool python script
- some parts failed due to not finding `pip3`
- note that the tool will say install complete even if not LOL
- ok the issue was `sudo pip` was for some reason invalid had to change it in the script to be just `pip3` and that worked!
  - note all the dependencies were already on my personal machine since they seem to be all the basic ones, the only new dep is opencv_python
- sas

## test_ram.py

- sad
